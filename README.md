# AVS Value Story

## A Framework for Multiplying Human Value in the Era of Autonomous Orchestration.

Developed by **Patrick Heaney**, this framework provides a rigorous methodological shift from "automating work" to **multiplying value** by externalizing tacit knowledge into **Algorithmically Legible Instructions**.

## 🚀 **The Problem: The Information Hunt**

The current crisis in knowledge work is characterized by the **"5–15 hour information hunt"**—time lost every week by workers simply trying to gather the context needed to do their actual jobs [cite: 1.1, 2.1]. This **"context blindness"** is the primary reason AI deployments fail, lead to hallucinations, or require excessive human oversight [cite: 2.4, 6.2].

# 💡 **The Solution: Agentic Value Streams (AVS)**

The Agentic Value Stream (AVS) tracks the flow of agency and decision-making rather than just static data [cite: 1.1]. It organizes the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a **cascading, iterative, and cumulative sequence** of value creation centered around the Value Story [cite: 1.1].

        %% Vertical flow connections
        VS-001 ==> VS-002 ==> VS-003 
    end

    Context[(MCP,<br>Database,<br>File System,<br>URL, etc)]

    %% Connections to the right
    VS-001 <-.-> Context
    VS-002 <-.-> Context
    VS-003 <-.-> Context
    VS-003 ==> Context
```

## Core Definitions

**Value Story**: The atomic unit of agentic work. It is a self-contained module comprising a **Goal** (Outcome), **Instructions** (Algorithm), and **Context-Manifest** (Data) [cite: 2.1.3].

Every Value Story in this repository follows the **Agile v1.2 Standard**, ensuring that every unit of work is aligned with a specific persona and business outcome:

* **As a [Persona]**: Defines the perspective and voice of the agent.

* **I want [Action]**: Defines the specific technical deliverable and success metrics.

* **So that [Value]**: Provides the "Why," allowing the agent to resolve ambiguities through the lens of intended value.

**Algorithmically Legible Instructions**: Precise enough for an AI-Agent to execute with zero "context blindness," yet semantically clear enough for Human-Agents to oversee and audit [cite: 2.2.2].

**Context-Manifest**: A mandatory component that shifts the burden of information retrieval from "runtime execution" to "design-time definition," effectively eliminating the "Information Hunt" [cite: 2.2.3].

## 🧠 The Strategic Shift

Under the **AVS Framework**, the highest-value human contributions complete the shift higher level thinking. Users shift from "doing the work" to strategicly generating and improving the goals, instructions, and context, used by Agentic-AI-Agents to produce the product. This moves the human architect from the role of a "task-manager" to a **"Orchestrator of Agency"** and moves the Agentic AI Agent from a "task-doer" to a **"force multiplier."**

## Illustrative Example

Before diving into the technical setup, you can explore a complete Illustrative Example focused on tailoring a resume. This walkthrough demonstrates how a sequence of Value Stories generates a high-fidelity "Strategic Alignment Matrix," mapping a candidate's background to specific job requirements to ensure the agent produces a competitive, fact-based product without context blindness.

# Getting Started

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have `uv` installed on your system:
Explore the Templates: Check the /templates folder for YAML schemas for creating your first Value Story.
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
## 2. Installation

Clone the repository and sync the environment:
```
git clone [https://github.com/PatrickHeaney/avs-value-story.git](https://github.com/PatrickHeaney/avs-value-story.git)
cd avs-value-story
uv sync
```
## 3. Your First Governance Pass

Validate the provided template to ensure your environment is configured correctly:
```
uv run avs validate vs-000-template.yaml
```
## 🛠 The Toolkit CLI

The `avs` toolkit provides a suite of commands to move from architectural intent to execution.

### `validate`

Checks a Value Story against the "Building Code" (Pydantic models). It ensures your goal is properly framed and your instructions meet the minimum precision requirements.
```
uv run avs validate illustrative-example/VS-001-logic-analysis.md
```

### `assemble`

The "Information Hunt" automation. It reads your `context_manifest`, fetches the raw text from your local files, and packages everything into a **Briefcase** (`*-assembled.yaml`) stamped with a unique `assembled_at` timestamp.
```
uv run avs assemble illustrative-example/VS-001-logic-analysis.md
```

### `run`

Executes the Value Story. If the file has not been assembled yet, `run` will automatically perform the assembly step before dispatching the payload to your local LLM (defaulting to Ollama/Llama3).
```
uv run avs run illustrative-example/VS-001-logic-analysis.md --local
```

🧠 **Advanced**: See [Model Orchestration Guide](docs/GUIDE_MODEL_ORCHESTRATION.md) for using specialized models like Gemma or Mistral.

## 📂 Architecture: Value Story vs. Briefcase

The AVS Toolkit manages the lifecycle of a Value Story through three distinct file types visible in the repository:

1.  **The Value Story (`VS-XXX.md`)**: The human-editable source of truth. It contains the Goal, Instructions, and pointers to context. This is what you commit to Git.
2.  **The Assembled VS (`VS-XXX-assembled.yaml`)**: An execution-ready snapshot. Created by `avs assemble`, it contains the logic plus the **full injected text** of all context assets.
3.  **The Output Product (`VS-XXX_output.md`)**: The final deliverable generated by the Agent. This is saved to the `output_path` defined in your Blueprint (e.g., `outputs/` or `illustrative-example/`).

> **Tip:** We recommend adding `*-assembled.yaml` to your `.gitignore` to prevent repository bloat and accidental exposure of sensitive context data.
