# AVS Value Story

## A Framework for Multiplying Human Value in the Era of Autonomous Orchestration.

Developed by **Patrick Heaney**, this framework provides a rigorous methodological shift from "automating work" to **multiplying value** by externalizing tacit knowledge into **Algorithmically Legible Instructions**.

## 🚀 **The Problem: The Information Hunt**

The current crisis in knowledge work is characterized by the **"5–15 hour information hunt"**—time lost every week by workers simply trying to gather the context needed to do their actual jobs [cite: 1.1, 2.1]. This **"context blindness"** is the primary reason AI deployments fail, lead to hallucinations, or require excessive human oversight [cite: 2.4, 6.2].

# 💡 **The Solution: Agentic Value Streams (AVS)**

The Agentic Value Stream (AVS) tracks the flow of agency and decision-making rather than just static data [cite: 1.1]. It organizes the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a **cascading, iterative, and cumulative sequence** of value creation centered around the Value Story [cite: 1.1].

    end

    Context[(MCP,<br>Database,<br>File System,<br>URL, etc)]

    %% Connections to the right
    VS-001 <-.-> Context
    VS-002 <-.-> Context
    VS-003 <-.-> Context
    VS-003 ==> Context
```

## Core Definitions

**Value Story**: The atomic unit of agentic work. It is a self-contained module comprising a **Goal** (Outcome), **Instructions** (Algorithm), and **Context-Manifest** (Data) [cite: 2.1.3].

Every Value Story in this repository follows the **Agile v1.2 Standard**, ensuring that every unit of work is aligned with a specific persona and business outcome:

* **As a [Persona]**: Defines the perspective and voice of the agent.

* **I want [Action]**: Defines the specific technical deliverable and success metrics.

* **So that [Value]**: Provides the "Why," allowing the agent to resolve ambiguities through the lens of intended value.

**Algorithmically Legible Instructions**: Precise enough for an AI-Agent to execute with zero "context blindness," yet semantically clear enough for Human-Agents to oversee and audit [cite: 2.2.2].

**Context-Manifest**: A mandatory component that shifts the burden of information retrieval from "runtime execution" to "design-time definition," effectively eliminating the "Information Hunt" [cite: 2.2.3].

## The Strategic Shift

Under the **AVS Framework**, the highest-value human contributions complete the shift higher level thinking. Users shift from "doing the work" to strategicly generating and improving the goals, instructions, and context, used by Agentic-AI-Agents to produce the product. This moves the human architect from the role of a "task-manager" to a **"Orchestrator of Agency"** and moves the Agentic AI Agent from a "task-doer" to a **"force multiplier."**

## 🤝 Getting Started

This project uses `uv` for ultra-fast, reproducible Python environment management.


Integrate with MCP: This repository includes implementation guides for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide mandatory context-manifest to your agents [cite: 7.1].

Contribute: Fork this repo to share your own "Algorithmically Legible" instructions for common industry value streams.

## ✨ Illustrative Example: Tailored Resume Generation

To demonstrate the power of Agentic Value Streams, consider the task of generating a tailored resume for a specific job application. This complex task can be broken down into a sequence of interconnected Value Stories:

### 1. VS-001: Analysis & Strategy

- **Goal:** Understand the job description and the candidate's existing resume to identify key skills, experiences, and keywords for optimal matching.
- **Instructions:**
    *   Parse job description to extract required skills, keywords, and responsibilities.
    *   Parse candidate's raw resume to identify relevant experience, education, and achievements.
    *   Perform a gap analysis between job requirements and candidate profile.
    *   Develop a strategic plan for resume tailoring, including prioritization of content and keyword integration.
- **Context-Manifest:** Job description (URL or text), Candidate's raw resume (PDF or text).
- **Product:** Strategy Report (The "Algorithm" for the next step).  

### 2. VS-002: Resume Generation

- **Goal:** Produce a draft resume tailored to the specific job application, following the strategic plan.
- **Instructions:**
    *   Select and prioritize relevant sections and bullet points from the candidate's raw resume based on the strategic plan.
    *   Rewrite/rephrase existing bullet points to incorporate job-specific keywords and align with the job description's language.
    *   Ensure resume adheres to best practices for formatting and readability.
- **Context-Manifest:** Output from VS-001 (strategic plan), Candidate's raw resume, Resume formatting guidelines.
- **Product:**  Tailored Resume Draft
### 3. VS-003: Audit (Hallucination Detection)

- **Goal:** Conduct a forensic audit of the tailored resume to ensure zero fabrication of facts. Identify and report any claims that deviate from the factual ground truth of the raw resume.
- **Instructions:**
    *   Compare tailored resume against job description for keyword density and thematic alignment.
    *   Check for clarity, conciseness, and absence of generic language.
    *   Identify any remaining gaps or areas for improvement.
    *   Suggest specific revisions to optimize the resume further.
- **Context-Manifest:** Tailored resume (draft), Original job description, Best practices for resume optimization.
- **Product:**  Audit Report & Finalized Resume.

### The Automation Step: Assembling the AI Prompt

Within each Value Story in the AVS framework, "Automation" isn't the AI thinking; it is the **assembly line** that builds the perfect prompt.

To multiply human value, we don't just "ask the AI." We automate assembling the prompt by combining:
1.  **The Goal:** The specific outcome defined by the human architect.
2.  **The Instructions:** The "Algorithmically Legible" logic for *how* to do the work.
3.  **The Context-Manifest:** The specific data (e.g., `job-description.md` and `raw-resume.md`) needed to prevent hallucination.

This process generates a single, auditable package (the Value Story YAML) that serves as the **Context-Rich, Algorithmically Legible Prompt** for the Agent.

*👉 Check the `/illustrative-example` folder to see the input files and the resulting assembled YAML.*

### Orchestration Sequence

This sequence diagram illustrates the temporal hand-off between the Human Architect, the Automation script (using uv), and the AI Agent for each story in the stream.

# Getting Started

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have `uv` installed on your system:
Explore the Templates: Check the /templates folder for YAML schemas for creating your first Value Story.
```
curl -LsSf [https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh](https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh) | sh
```
## 2. Installation

Clone the repository and sync the environment:
```
git clone [https://github.com/PatrickHeaney/avs-value-story.git](https://github.com/PatrickHeaney/avs-value-story.git)
cd avs-value-story
uv sync
```
## 3. Your First Governance Pass

Validate the provided template to ensure your environment is configured correctly:
```
uv run avs validate vs-000-template.yaml
```
## 🛠 The Toolkit CLI

The `avs` toolkit provides a suite of commands to move from architectural intent to execution.

### `validate`

Checks a Value Story against the "Building Code" (Pydantic models). It ensures your goal is properly framed and your instructions meet the minimum precision requirements.
```
uv run avs validate illustrative-example/VS-001-logic-analysis.md
```

### `assemble`

The "Information Hunt" automation. It reads your `context_manifest`, fetches the raw text from your local files, and packages everything into a **Briefcase** (`*-assembled.yaml`) stamped with a unique `assembled_at` timestamp.
```
uv run avs assemble illustrative-example/VS-001-logic-analysis.md
```

### `run`

Executes the Value Story. If the file has not been assembled yet, `run` will automatically perform the assembly step before dispatching the payload to your local LLM (defaulting to Ollama/Llama3).
```
uv run avs run illustrative-example/VS-001-logic-analysis.md --local
```

## 📂 Architecture: Blueprint vs. Briefcase

To maintain a clean and auditable repository, AVS distinguishes between two file states:

1. **The Blueprint (`VS-XXX.md`)**: The human-readable source of truth. It contains your logic and references to data, but not the data itself. This is what you commit to Git.

2. **The Briefcase (`VS-XXX-assembled.yaml`)**: An execution snapshot containing the logic **plus** the full content of all context files.

> **Tip:** We recommend adding `*-assembled.yaml` to your `.gitignore` to prevent repository bloat and accidental exposure of sensitive context data.

## 🏗 Repository Structure

* `src/avs_toolkit/`: The core engine (Models, Parser, CLI).

* `illustrative-example/`: A complete end-to-end Value Stream (Resume Tailoring).

* `vs-000-template.yaml`: The master blueprint for creating new stories.

* `Visual-Studio-Code-Setup-Guide.md`: Recommended extensions for an optimal AVS dev environment.
