# AVS Value Story

## A Framework for Multiplying Human Value in the Era of Autonomous Orchestration.

Developed by **Patrick Heaney**, this framework provides a rigorous methodological shift from "automating work" to **multiplying value** by externalizing tacit knowledge into **Algorithmically Legible Instructions**.

🚀 **The Problem: The Information Hunt**

The current crisis in knowledge work is characterized by the **"5–15 hour information hunt"**—time lost every week by workers simply trying to gather the context needed to do their actual jobs [cite: 1.1, 2.1]. This **"context blindness"** is the primary reason AI deployments fail, lead to hallucinations, or require excessive human oversight [cite: 2.4, 6.2].

💡 **The Solution: Agentic Value Streams (AVS)**

The Agentic Value Stream (AVS) tracks the flow of agency and decision-making rather than just static data [cite: 1.1]. It organizes the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a **cascading, iterative, and cumulative sequence** of value creation centered around the Value Story [cite: 1.1].

### Core Definitions

**Value Story**: The atomic unit of agentic work. It is a self-contained module comprising a **Goal** (Outcome), **Instructions** (Algorithm), and **Context-Manifest** (Data) [cite: 2.1.3].

**Algorithmically Legible Instructions**: Precise enough for an AI-Agent to execute with zero "context blindness," yet semantically clear enough for Human-Agents to oversee and audit [cite: 2.2.2].

**Context-Manifest**: A mandatory component that shifts the burden of information retrieval from "runtime execution" to "design-time definition," effectively eliminating the "Information Hunt" [cite: 2.2.3].

## 🛠️ Framework Architecture

### The Strategic Shift

Under the **AVS Framework**, the highest-value human contributions completes the shift from "doing the work" to generating and improving the goals, instructions, and context used by Agentic-AI-Agents to produce the product. This moves the human architect from the role of a "task-manager" to a **"Orchestrator of Agency"** and moves the Agentic AI Agent from a "task-doer" to a **"force multiplier."**

## ✨ Illustrative Example: Tailored Resume Generation

To demonstrate the power of Agentic Value Streams, consider the task of generating a tailored resume for a specific job application. This complex task can be broken down into a sequence of interconnected Value Stories:

### 1. VS-001: Analysis & Strategy

**Goal:** Understand the job description and the candidate's existing resume to identify key skills, experiences, and keywords for optimal matching.

**Instructions:**
*   Parse job description to extract required skills, keywords, and responsibilities.
*   Parse candidate's raw resume to identify relevant experience, education, and achievements.
*   Perform a gap analysis between job requirements and candidate profile.
*   Develop a strategic plan for resume tailoring, including prioritization of content and keyword integration.


**Context-Manifest:** Job description (URL or text), Candidate's raw resume (PDF or text).

### 2. VS-002: Resume Generation

**Goal:** Produce a draft resume tailored to the specific job application, following the strategic plan.

**Instructions:**
*   Select and prioritize relevant sections and bullet points from the candidate's raw resume based on the strategic plan.
*   Rewrite/rephrase existing bullet points to incorporate job-specific keywords and align with the job description's language.
*   Ensure resume adheres to best practices for formatting and readability.

**Context-Manifest:** Output from VS-001 (strategic plan), Candidate's raw resume, Resume formatting guidelines.

### 3. VS-003: Audit (Hallucination Detection)

**Goal:** Conduct a forensic audit of the tailored resume to ensure zero fabrication of facts. Identify and report any claims that deviate from the factual ground truth of the raw resume.

**Instructions:**
*   Compare tailored resume against job description for keyword density and thematic alignment.
*   Check for clarity, conciseness, and absence of generic language.
*   Identify any remaining gaps or areas for improvement.
*   Suggest specific revisions to optimize the resume further.

**Context-Manifest:** Tailored resume (draft), Original job description, Best practices for resume optimization.

### Value Stream Flow

The sequence of these Value Stories forms a clear, auditable Agentic Value Stream:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Agentic Value Stream (AVS)"
    A[User Request: Job + Candidate Resume] --> B(VS-001: Analysis & Strategy)
    B --> C(VS-002: Resume Generation)
    C --> D(VS-003: Audit Report & Tailored Resume)
    end
```

### The Automation Step: Assembling the AI Prompt

In the AVS framework, "Automation" isn't the AI thinking; it is the **assembly line** that builds the perfect prompt.

To multiply human value, we don't just "ask the AI." We systematically assemble the prompt by combining:
1.  **The Goal:** The specific outcome defined by the human architect.
2.  **The Instructions:** The "Algorithmically Legible" logic for *how* to do the work.
3.  **The Context-Manifest:** The specific data (e.g., `job-description.md` and `raw-resume.md`) needed to prevent hallucination.

This process generates a single, auditable package (the Value Story YAML) that serves as the **Context-Rich, Algorithmically Legible Prompt** for the Agent.

*👉 Check the `/illustrative-example` folder to see the input files and the resulting assembled YAML.*

### Updated Value Stream Flow

The full end-to-end pipeline for the tailored resume generation demonstrates the complete AVS framework:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Human-Agent Input"
        JD[Job Description]
        CR[Candidate Raw Resume]
    end

    subgraph "VS-001: Analysis & Strategy"
        direction TB
        L1[Logic: VS-001-logic-analysis.md] --> A1[Automation: assemble_prompt.py]
        JD -- Context-Manifest --> A1
        CR -- Context-Manifest --> A1
        A1 --> P1(VS-001-assembled.yaml Prompt)
        P1 --> AI1["AI Agent (Analyzes)"]
        AI1 --> SP[Product: Strategic Plan]
    end

    subgraph "VS-002: Resume Generation"
        direction TB
        L2[Logic: VS-002-logic-generation.md] --> A2[Automation: assemble_prompt.py]
        SP -. Context-Manifest .-> A2
        CR -- Context-Manifest --> A2
        JD -- Context-Manifest --> A2
        A2 --> P2(VS-002-assembled.yaml Prompt)
        P2 --> AI2["AI Agent (Generates)"]
        AI2 --> TR[Product: Tailored Resume]
    end

    subgraph "VS-003: Audit & Remediate"
        direction TB
        L3[Logic: VS-003-logic-audit.md] --> A3[Automation: assemble_prompt.py]
        TR -. Context-Manifest .-> A3
        CR -- Context-Manifest --> A3
        A3 --> P3(VS-003-assembled.yaml Prompt)
        P3 --> AI3["AI Agent (Audits)"]
        AI3 --> AR[Product: Audit Report & Final Resume]
    end

    AR --> HumanReview[Human-Agent Review]
```

### The Assembly Process

The core of AVS is the "Automation" step, where human-defined logic and context are assembled into an AI-ready prompt. For this example, the `illustrative-example/assemble_prompt.py` script orchestrates this. It reads a Value Story's logic (`VS-XXX-logic-XXX.md`)—which now includes a `context_manifest`—and dynamically embeds the specified input files into a comprehensive `VS-XXX-assembled.yaml` prompt.

### Running the Example

To fully experience this end-to-end Value Stream, navigate to the project root and execute the assembly script for each Value Story. The script will generate the `VS-XXX-assembled.yaml` prompt, which you would then provide to your chosen AI Agent. The AI's output from one step often becomes the input (context) for the next.

**1. Assemble VS-001 (Analysis & Strategy)**
This step combines the job description and raw resume into a prompt for the AI to generate a strategic plan.
```bash
uv run illustrative-example/assemble_prompt.py --logic illustrative-example/VS-001-logic-analysis.md --output VS-001-assembled.yaml
# Manually 'run' VS-001-assembled.yaml as a prompt to get the Strategic Plan.
# The output (Strategic Plan) should be saved to: illustrative-example/InnovateCorp_Senior-Product-Manager-AI-Solutions_Strategic-Plan.md
```

**2. Assemble VS-002 (Resume Generation)**
This step combines the strategic plan, raw resume, and job description into a prompt for the AI to generate a tailored resume.
```bash
uv run illustrative-example/assemble_prompt.py --logic illustrative-example/VS-002-logic-generation.md --output VS-002-assembled.yaml
# Manually 'run' VS-002-assembled.yaml as a prompt to get the Tailored Resume.
# The output (Tailored Resume) should be saved to: illustrative-example/InnovateCorp_Senior-Product-Manager-AI-Solutions_Tailored-Resume.md
```

**3. Assemble VS-003 (Audit)**
This step combines the tailored resume and the raw resume into a prompt for the AI to audit for factual consistency and generate a report.
```bash
uv run illustrative-example/assemble_prompt.py --logic illustrative-example/VS-003-logic-audit.md --output VS-003-assembled.yaml
# Manually 'run' VS-003-assembled.yaml as a prompt to get the Audit Report.
# The output (Audit Report) should be saved to: illustrative-example/InnovateCorp_Senior-Product-Manager-AI-Solutions_Hallucination-Audit-Report.md
