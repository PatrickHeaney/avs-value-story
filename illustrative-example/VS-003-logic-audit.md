# VS-003: Audit & Remediate
```

to eliminate hallucinations while maintaining strategic alignment.

# THE GOAL: The "North Star" for the Agentic-Agent.
goal:
  as_a: "As a Forensic Document Auditor"
  i_want: >
    Perform a forensic fact-check of the Tailored Resume against the Raw Resume.
    - Requirement 1: Identify all hallucinations (claims unsupported by the raw resume).
    - Requirement 2: Rewrite the resume to be 100% factually accurate while maintaining strategic alignment.
    - Requirement 3: Ensure zero 'Critical' severity hallucinations remain in the final output.
  so_that: >
    The final resume is a high-integrity document that preserves the strategic 
    tailoring of VS-002 without compromising factual truth, protecting the 
    candidate from background check failures.

# INSTRUCTIONS: Must be "Algorithmically Legible."
instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: "Reflection"
  execution_steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Ingest the 'Tailored Resume' and extract every distinct claim (Employer, Title, Dates, Degree, Specific Metric/KPI, Skill)."
      validation_rule: "Agent has a structured list of claims to verify."
    - step: 2
      action: "Cross-reference each extracted claim against the 'Raw Resume' (Ground Truth). Flag any claim where the substance of the fact has changed."
      validation_rule: "Strict zero-tolerance policy for unsupported additions."
    - step: 3
      action: "Generate an Audit Report categorizing issues as 'Hallucinations' (Critical) or 'Inferences' (Minor)."
      validation_rule: "List is explicit, evidentiary, and identifies the specific offending text."
    - step: 4
      action: "REMEDIATE: Rewrite the specific bullet points to remove invented facts and replace them with the strongest truthful alternatives."
      validation_rule: "Strategic keywords are maintained only if they describe a truth supported by the source."
    - step: 5
      action: "Output a single document containing the 'Hallucination Audit Report' followed by the final 'Remediated Resume'."
      validation_rule: "Final document provides both the audit transparency and the finished product."
  constraints:
    - "You may strategically reframe and re-prioritize facts but MUST NOT invent new ones."
    - "Save the document to 'company_job-title_Audit-Report-and-Final-Resume.md'."
