# Value Story Logic: VS-002 Resume Generation
#
# This file contains the Goal and Instructions for the "Resume Generation"
# Value Story (VS-002). It is designed to be ingested by the
# 'assemble_prompt.py' script.
#
# INPUT: Strategic Plan (VS-001 Output) + Raw Resume + Job Description
# OUTPUT: A tailored Markdown Resume
# ==============================================================================

# THE GOAL: The "Minimum Unique Information" needed to produce the product.
# This defines the "North Star" for the Agent's internal reasoning loop.

goal:
  outcome_statement: "Generate a fully tailored resume in Markdown format that strictly adheres to the provided Strategic Plan and targets the specific job description."
  success_metrics:
    - "Resume includes all 'Key Additions' and 'Tailoring Actions' specified in the Strategic Plan."
    - "Resume uses specific keywords from the Job Description (e.g., 'B2B SaaS', 'NLP')."
    - "Summary section is rewritten to position the candidate as a 'Technical Product Leader'."

# INSTRUCTIONS: Must be "Algorithmically Legible."
# Precise enough for AI execution, clear enough for Human audit.

instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: "Planning"
  execution_steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Review the 'Strategic Plan' to identify specific required changes, keyword insertions, and thematic pivots."
      validation_rule: "Agent has a mental list of 'must-have' edits."
    - step: 2
      action: "Rewrite the 'Professional Summary' of the Raw Resume. Incorporate the 'Key Phrase to Add' from the Strategic Plan."
      validation_rule: "Summary explicitly mentions 'Computer Science background' and 'MBA'."
    - step: 3
      action: "Reconstruct the 'Experience' section. For each role, apply the specific 'Tailoring Actions' defined in the Strategic Plan (e.g., changing 'specs' to 'PRDs')."
      validation_rule: "All generic terms flagged in the plan are replaced with specific keywords."
    - step: 4
      action: "Optimize the 'Skills' section. Re-order and add keywords (NLP, AWS, Agile) as directed by the plan."
      validation_rule: "Skills section prioritizes Technical and AI-relevant skills."
    - step: 5
      action: "Output the final resume in clean, standard Markdown format."
      validation_rule: "Output contains ONLY the resume content, no conversational filler."

  constraints:
    - "Do not invent new work history or degrees (hallucination check)."
    - "Do not remove the 'Education' section."
    - "Save the generated resume to 'company_job-title_Tailored-Resume.md'."
