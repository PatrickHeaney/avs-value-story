  i_want: >
    Generate a fully tailored resume in Markdown format that strictly adheres to the provided 
    Strategic Plan and targets the specific job description.
    - Requirement 1: Resume must include all 'Key Additions' and 'Tailoring Actions' from the Strategic Plan.
    - Requirement 2: Summary section must position the candidate as a 'Technical Product Leader'.
    - Requirement 3: Use specific keywords from the JD (e.g., 'B2B SaaS', 'NLP').

    The candidate presents a perfectly aligned professional narrative that passes both 
    ATS and human screening filters by demonstrating exact fit for the role.

# INSTRUCTIONS: Must be "Algorithmically Legible."
instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: "Planning"
  execution_steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Review the 'Strategic Plan' to identify specific required changes, keyword insertions, and thematic pivots."
      validation_rule: "Agent has a mental list of 'must-have' edits derived from the strategy."
    - step: 2
      action: "Rewrite the 'Professional Summary' of the Raw Resume, incorporating 'Key Phrases' from the Strategic Plan."
      validation_rule: "Summary explicitly mentions 'Computer Science background' and 'MBA'."
    - step: 3
      action: "Reconstruct the 'Experience' section, applying 'Tailoring Actions' (e.g., changing 'specs' to 'PRDs')."
      validation_rule: "All generic terms flagged in the plan are replaced with specific keywords."
    - step: 4
      action: "Optimize the 'Skills' section by re-ordering and adding keywords as directed by the plan."
      validation_rule: "Skills section prioritizes Technical and AI-relevant skills."
    - step: 5
      action: "Output the final resume in clean, standard Markdown format."
      validation_rule: "Output contains ONLY the resume content, with zero conversational filler."
  constraints:
    - "You MUST NOT invent, embellish, or infer any new facts outside of the provided sources."
    - "Do not remove the 'Education' section."
    - "Save the generated resume to 'company_job-title_Tailored-Resume.md'."
