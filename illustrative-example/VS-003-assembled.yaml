    strategic alignment. - Requirement 3: Ensure zero ''Critical'' severity hallucinations
    remain in the final output.

    of VS-002 without compromising factual truth, protecting the  candidate from background
    check failures.

    or 'Inferences' (Minor).

    text.
- step_number: 4
  action: 'REMEDIATE: Rewrite the specific bullet points to remove invented facts
    and replace them with the strongest truthful alternatives.'
  validation_rule: Strategic keywords are maintained only if they describe a truth
    supported by the source.
- step_number: 5
  action: Output a single document containing the 'Hallucination Audit Report' followed
    by the final 'Remediated Resume'.
