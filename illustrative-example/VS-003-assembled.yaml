goal:
  outcome_statement: Perform a forensic fact-check of the Tailored Resume against
    the Raw Resume. Identify all hallucinations and rewrite the resume to be 100%
    factually accurate while maintaining strategic alignment.
  success_metrics:
  - Zero 'Critical' severity hallucinations remain in the final output.
  - All claims in the Remediated Resume are traceable to the Raw Resume.
  - The resume remains tailored (keywords/phrasing) but within the bounds of truth.
instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: Reflection
  execution_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Ingest the 'Tailored Resume' and extract every distinct claim (Employer,
      Title, Dates, Degree, Specific Metric/KPI, Skill).
    validation_rule: Agent has a structured list of claims to verify.
  - step: 2
    action: Cross-reference each extracted claim against the 'Raw Resume' (Ground
      Truth). Flag any claim where the *substance* of the fact has changed (e.g.,
      adding 'AI' to a project that didn't have it).
    validation_rule: Strict zero-tolerance for unsupported additions.
  - step: 3
    action: Generate a list of 'Hallucinations' (Critical Violations) and 'Inferences'
      (Minor Violations).
    validation_rule: List is explicit and evidentiary.
  - step: 4
    action: 'REMEDIATE: For every Critical Violation, rewrite the specific sentence/bullet
      point. Remove the invented fact and replace it with the strongest *truthful*
      alternative from the Raw Resume.'
    validation_rule: If 'AI' was invented, revert to 'Complex Software' or 'Data-Driven'
      if supported.
  - step: 5
    action: 'Output a single markdown document containing: (1) The ''Hallucination
      Audit Report'' followed by a horizontal rule, and then (2) The final ''Remediated
      Resume''.'
    validation_rule: Final document provides both transparency (the audit) and the
      product (the resume).
  constraints:
  - You may strategically reframe and re-prioritize facts from the raw_resume.
  - You MUST NOT invent, embellish, or infer any new facts, skills, metrics, or experiences
    outside of this sources. This guardrail is absolute.
  - Save the document to 'company_job-title_Audit-Report-and-Final-Resume.md'.
