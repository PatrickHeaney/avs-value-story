# Strategic Resume Tailoring Plan
**Candidate:** John Doe
**Target Role:** Senior Product Manager - AI Solutions @ InnovateCorp

## 1. Executive Summary Strategy
**Goal:** Position John as a Technical Product Manager who bridges the gap between business strategy and technical engineering.
*   **Action:** Rewrite the summary to lead with his unique combination of **MBA + BS Computer Science**.
*   **Reframing:** Highlight his 9+ years of experience managing **"complex B2B software lifecycles"** and his hands-on technical background (**Python, AWS**) as the foundation for leading AI/ML product initiatives.

## 2. Experience Section Tailoring

### Role: Senior Product Manager | Tech Innovations Inc.
*   **Focus:** Scale and Data-Driven Decision Making.
*   **Tailoring Actions:**
    *   *Bullet 1:* Reframe "SaaS platform" to **"Data-driven SaaS platform"** (if accurate to the product's nature, avoiding "AI" if not true). Focus on the *complexity* of the system.
    *   *Bullet 4:* Highlight collaboration with **Engineering** to validate technical feasibility. Use this to prove he can handle the "work closely with AI/ML engineers" requirement by proxy.
    *   *New Emphasis:* Explicitly mention utilizing **AWS** or cloud technologies if he managed them in this role, to hit the "Cloud platforms" requirement.

### Role: Product Manager | Global Software Solutions
*   **Focus:** Product Lifecycle & Requirements.
*   **Tailoring Actions:**
    *   Change "detailed product specifications" to **"Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and User Stories"** to match the Job Description's exact terminology.
    *   Emphasize the **"B2B"** nature of this role to align with InnovateCorp's B2B focus.

### Role: Software Developer | Creative Digital Agency
*   **Focus:** Technical Credibility.
*   **Tailoring Actions:**
    *   Ensure **Python** is bolded. This is his strongest proof point for technical aptitude.

## 3. Skills Section Optimization
**Goal:** Align taxonomy with the JD.
*   **Re-order:** Move **"Technical"** skills higher or integrate them into a "Core Competencies" list.
*   **Keywords to Prioritize:**
    *   **Machine Learning Fundamentals** (Move to top of Technical list).
    *   **AWS** (Ensure visibility).
    *   **Agile/Scrum**.
    *   **Product Lifecycle Management**.
    *   **Go-to-Market Strategy**.

## 4. Gap Mitigation (Honest Approach)
*   **The Gap:** "Deep understanding of AI/ML concepts" and "NLP."
*   **The Fix:** Do **NOT** invent NLP experience. Instead, lean heavily on his **"Machine Learning Fundamentals"** skill and **Computer Science degree**.
*   **Recommendation:** If John has done any self-study or side projects in AI/NLP that aren't on the resume, he should add a **"Projects"** or **"Professional Development"** section to list them. This is the only compliant way to fill this gap.
