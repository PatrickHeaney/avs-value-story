  success_metrics:
  - Resume includes all 'Key Additions' and 'Tailoring Actions' specified in the Strategic
    Plan.
  - Resume uses specific keywords from the Job Description (e.g., 'B2B SaaS', 'NLP').
  - Summary section is rewritten to position the candidate as a 'Technical Product
    Leader'.
instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: Planning
  execution_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Review the 'Strategic Plan' to identify specific required changes, keyword
      insertions, and thematic pivots.
    validation_rule: Agent has a mental list of 'must-have' edits.
  - step: 2

      'Tailoring Actions' defined in the Strategic Plan (e.g., changing 'specs' to
      'PRDs').

      keywords.

  - You may strategically reframe and re-prioritize facts from the raw_resume You
    MUST NOT invent, embellish, or infer any new facts, skills, metrics, or experiences
    outside of this sources. This guardrail is absolute.
  - Do not remove the 'Education' section.
  - Save the generated resume to 'company_job-title_Tailored-Resume.md'.

      \ Role:** Senior Product Manager - AI Solutions @ InnovateCorp\n\n## 1. Executive\
      \ Summary Strategy\n**Goal:** Position John as a Technical Product Manager who\
      \ bridges the gap between business strategy and technical engineering.\n*  \
      \ **Action:** Rewrite the summary to lead with his unique combination of **MBA\
      \ + BS Computer Science**.\n*   **Reframing:** Highlight his 9+ years of experience\
      \ managing **\"complex B2B software lifecycles\"** and his hands-on technical\
      \ background (**Python, AWS**) as the foundation for leading AI/ML product initiatives.\n\
      \n## 2. Experience Section Tailoring\n\n### Role: Senior Product Manager | Tech\
      \ Innovations Inc.\n*   **Focus:** Scale and Data-Driven Decision Making.\n\
      *   **Tailoring Actions:**\n    *   *Bullet 1:* Reframe \"SaaS platform\" to\
      \ **\"Data-driven SaaS platform\"** (if accurate to the product's nature, avoiding\
      \ \"AI\" if not true). Focus on the *complexity* of the system.\n    *   *Bullet\
      \ 4:* Highlight collaboration with **Engineering** to validate technical feasibility.\
      \ Use this to prove he can handle the \"work closely with AI/ML engineers\"\
      \ requirement by proxy.\n    *   *New Emphasis:* Explicitly mention utilizing\
      \ **AWS** or cloud technologies if he managed them in this role, to hit the\
      \ \"Cloud platforms\" requirement.\n\n### Role: Product Manager | Global Software\
      \ Solutions\n*   **Focus:** Product Lifecycle & Requirements.\n*   **Tailoring\
      \ Actions:**\n    *   Change \"detailed product specifications\" to **\"Product\
      \ Requirements Documents (PRDs) and User Stories\"** to match the Job Description's\
      \ exact terminology.\n    *   Emphasize the **\"B2B\"** nature of this role\
      \ to align with InnovateCorp's B2B focus.\n\n### Role: Software Developer |\
      \ Creative Digital Agency\n*   **Focus:** Technical Credibility.\n*   **Tailoring\
      \ Actions:**\n    *   Ensure **Python** is bolded. This is his strongest proof\
      \ point for technical aptitude.\n\n## 3. Skills Section Optimization\n**Goal:**\
      \ Align taxonomy with the JD.\n*   **Re-order:** Move **\"Technical\"** skills\
      \ higher or integrate them into a \"Core Competencies\" list.\n*   **Keywords\
      \ to Prioritize:**\n    *   **Machine Learning Fundamentals** (Move to top of\
      \ Technical list).\n    *   **AWS** (Ensure visibility).\n    *   **Agile/Scrum**.\n\
      \    *   **Product Lifecycle Management**.\n    *   **Go-to-Market Strategy**.\n\
      \n## 4. Gap Mitigation (Honest Approach)\n*   **The Gap:** \"Deep understanding\
      \ of AI/ML concepts\" and \"NLP.\"\n*   **The Fix:** Do **NOT** invent NLP experience.\
      \ Instead, lean heavily on his **\"Machine Learning Fundamentals\"** skill and\
      \ **Computer Science degree**.\n*   **Recommendation:** If John has done any\
      \ self-study or side projects in AI/NLP that aren't on the resume, he should\
      \ add a **\"Projects\"** or **\"Professional Development\"** section to list\
      \ them. This is the only compliant way to fill this gap."
